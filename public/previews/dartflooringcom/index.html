<h3>What our customers are saying</h3>
<blockquote>We appreciate your professional and prompt service in taking care of our carpeting needs. Job well done! We will keep your card on file for any future flooring needs we may have.</blockquote>
<cite>Jerry and Sara</cite>
<blockquote>Dan, Just wanted to let you know that we are VERY pleased with the new carpet in our den. Your advice when choosing the right carpet was greatly appreciated. Also, very pleased with the installation process. It was a pleasure working with someone who followed through with everything promised. We have already recommended you to a friend.</blockquote>
<cite>Peg B</cite>
<blockquote>Can't thank you enough for the awesome job you guys did on our kitchen floor. The quality and the \"extra touches\" you added for us around our island are perfect. This is the second job you've done for us in our home and based on how well things have gone and the extra time and effort you put into each job, it won't be the last! We really appreciate the personal care we get when doing business with you!</blockquote>
<cite>Patrick D</cite>
<blockquote>Dan arrived at my home on a Sunday (unheard of) and carefully explained my options. He arrived when he said he would and kept me informed throughout the process. He went above and beyond what any big box store would do by replacing a toilet for me at no extra charge to avoid future problems with my flooring. He exceeded my expectations!</blockquote>
<cite>Kathryn H</cite>
<blockquote>Dan's estimate was very fair and he offered lot's of feedback on questions about the finished work for the laminate flooring. I like that he brought the samples with him so we could choose right then and he takes care of ordering, etc. The quality of the work is excellent. He and his son did most of the work and his brother helped on the last day. Dan even helped remove a crease in the carpet that we've had for years. They cleaned up, just as promised. I would most definitely use Dan again for any flooring needs. I already referred him to a friend who had him remove old and install new carpeting. She was also impressed with his pricing and quality of work. We couldn't be happier with the results. Thanks, Dan!</blockquote>
<cite>Denise D</cite>
<blockquote>We could not be happier with the job that Dan, Todd, and Scott did for us. They were most cautious with our furnishings, did everything they could to mitigate the dust from demolition, and installed beautiful carpet and laminate floor for us in a timely manner. These guys are genuinely nice, honest, hard working professionals. I recommend their services to any and all.</blockquote>
<cite>Thomas S</cite>
<blockquote>Dan, Todd and Scott were respectful, professional and very up front with what to expect.</blockquote>
<cite>Deborah Q</cite>
<blockquote>The work was professional in every sense of the word. The friendliness and attention to detail were greatly appreciated, as a number of things were done to make the job perfect. Clean up was thorough and all refuse removed. We couldn't be happier with our beautiful new floor and the outstanding service provided. We wouldn't hesitate in using this company again.</blockquote>
